This is an example of Graph Convolutional Network.  
T. Kipf and M. Welling's GCN.  

I will read their repos and code, and manage to implement(copy) the GCN model in different structures.  

> 1. PyTorch Geometric (PyG)  
> 2. Deep Graph Library (DGL)  
> 3. PyTorch (Raw PyTorch)  
> 4. Tensorflow (Raw TensorFlow)  
> ...

As for 3. and 4., I will have a look at Kipf's GitHub repo, and I will have a little "change" (to my own taste...)  

The coding taste(flavor) I am using is called "MingFei Style"
